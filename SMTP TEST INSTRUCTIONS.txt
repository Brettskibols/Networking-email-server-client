 HELO + domain (Sends hello to server and receive a confirmation message back)

 MAIL FROM: (enter the senders email)

 RCPT TO:   (Enter the recipients email - can be repeated as many times as wanted)

 DATA (has to be entered after MAIL and RCPT enter many lines and '.' on an empty line to complete sending the message)

 HELP (To obtain the help command message)

 RSET (Resets the server to the connection established state + also resets email buffers and message buffers to initial state) 

 NOOP (Sends a message to the server and obtains a 250 OK back confirming the server is still running)

 QUIT (Sends a message to the server to quit and read)

 HELP, RSET, NOOP and QUIT can be used from any point but MAIL, RCPT and DATA have to be entered in order, error codes enabled for
 incorrect entry so please try these and break the ordering.
